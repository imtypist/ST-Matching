# ST-Matching

ST-Matching is proposed in *Map-matching for low-sampling-rate GPS trajectories*, which is a map matching algorithm usually used for handling low sampling rate GPS trajectories. This paper is also avaliable in my repository, you can download it.

Then, I will introduce the flow of ST-Matching and how to run this program.

### Work flow of ST-Matching

In this section, I will show a flow chart of ST-Matching algorithm. **To be added...**

### What I use in this project

- PostgreSQL 10
  - NOTE : [How to operate PostgreSQL using C/C++?](https://segmentfault.com/a/1190000000628234)
- Visual Studio 2017 
  - recomended, some other IDEs are OK

### Preprocess of OSM

### Acknowledgement

This project is based on the same name repository of [@AzoresCabbage](https://github.com/AzoresCabbage). I try to reconstruct the project and make it easier to use. If there is any problem, please let me know.
